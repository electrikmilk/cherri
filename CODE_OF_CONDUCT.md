# Code of Conduct

The purpose of this project is to create and maintain the Cherri programming language. If you would like to
be a part of that, keep your interaction with this project focused solely on that goal.

1. Have fun, but do your best to stay technical.
2. No discussion unrelated to the Cherri programming language. Related topics include Apple (the tech company), macOS, iOS, iOS Shortcuts app, and
   the Workflow iOS app, but please only make mention of them as it relates to Cherri or a change to Shortcuts.
3. Do your best with contributions and communication.
4. Please handle conflicts with others in private, do not contact any members of this project to handle situations
   for you. Do your best to stay technical and "be the better person" if someone is behaving in a way that bothers you.
5. No when-posting. You may suggest, but do not request or expect features. Refrain from asking when some feature
   will happen unless you are actively working on or contributing to it. Still want a feature really badly? Be the
   change you wish to see. Talk is cheap, show your code.
6. No soliciting of any kind.
7. Do your best to stay positive and not bring others down just because you're having a bad day.
8. Be practical and honest, but not discouraging or pessimistic. It does not help anything or anyone.
9. No flame or brand wars (off-topic, trashing other languages, etc.).
