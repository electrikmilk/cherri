**Cherri** (pronounced cherry) is a [Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752) programming language, that compiles directly to a valid runnable Shortcut.

The main goal is to make it trivial and practical to create large Shortcut projects (within the limits of Shortcuts) and maintain them long-term.

[![Hello World Example](https://github.com/electrikmilk/cherri/assets/4368524/4205308b-4358-47c9-a1b4-66930c8db1c2)](https://playground.cherrilang.org)

## 📣 WIP 📣

This project has not yet reached a stable version. It is under heavy development and backward
incompatible changes may be made.

## Usage

```bash
cherri file.cherri
```

Run `cherri` without any arguments to see all options and usage. For development, use the `--debug` (or `-d`) option to print
stack traces, debug information, and output a `.plist` file.

## Why macOS only?

Generating valid Shortcuts is only possible on macOS. However, there is a [Cherri Playground](https://playground.cherrilang.org) that outputs valid Shortcuts on any platform with a web
browser.

### Development on other platforms

As it stands, I don't want someone to get confused and think Shortcuts compiled using Cherri on other platforms will run
on their Mac or iOS device. However, you can build the compiler for your platform, it will just skip signing the
compiled Shortcut, so it will not run on iOS 15+ or macOS 12+. Also, note that the compiler is primarily developed and
tested on Unix-like systems.

## Why another Shortcuts language?

Because it's fun :)

Some languages have been abandoned, don't work very well, or no longer work. I don't want Shortcuts languages to die.
There should be more, not less.

Plus, some stability comes with this project being on macOS and not iOS, and I'm not aware of another Shortcuts language with macOS as its platform other than [Buttermilk](https://github.com/zachary7829/Buttermilk).

_The original Workflow app assigned a code name to each release. Cherri is named after the second to last
update "Cherries" (also cherry is one of my favorite flavors)._

This project started on Oct 5, 2022.
